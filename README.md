The single-family real estate market in the United States has changed drastically since 2000, influenced by a web of different factors such as population migration, price fluctuations, and social dynamics. As the market continues to evolve, understanding these drivers becomes essential for decision-making. Our analysis aims to provide clear insights into what drives price changes in the single-family real estate market, using data on economic indicators, population estimates, and home prices.
Central to our analysis are key variables such as economic indicators, population estimates, average home prices, and regional disparities in the United States. Economic data referenced from the Regional Data set by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, and average home prices sourced from Zillow Home Value Index, supported our analysis. By conducting correlation and permutation tests, supported by visualizations, we aim to understand the factors driving price fluctuations in the single-family real estate market.
